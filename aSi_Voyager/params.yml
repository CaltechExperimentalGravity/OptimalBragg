#  parameter file for doing cost function minimization for optimal coating design
#
# This specifies the terms to include in your cost func
costs:
        - Trans   # Optimize for a target transmission
        - coatBr  # Optimize for a target brownian noise level
        - coatTO  # Optimize for a target thermo-optic noise level
        - sensL   # Minimize sensitivity to manufacturing tolerances on optical thickness
        - surfE   # Minimize the surface E field
          #- absorp  # Minimize absorption (not yet...)

# Use this to specify the target levels for each term in the cost func
# There has to be one target per term in the cost
targets:
        - 5.e-6    # 5 ppm target transmission
        - 1.        # chosen to match MATLAB optim
        - 1.e+42   # chosen to match MATLAB optim
        - 1.e-2    # NOT Used currently
        - 50       # NOT used currently
# Specify the relative importance of terms in the cost func

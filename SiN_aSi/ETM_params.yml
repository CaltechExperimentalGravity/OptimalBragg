#  parameter file for doing cost function minimization for optimal coating design

# This specifies the terms to include in your cost function. To exclude 
# certain costs from the optimization run, simply set weight to 0.0
costs:
    # PSL wavelength transmission

        target: 5e-6
        weight: 2e1
    # Brownian noise level

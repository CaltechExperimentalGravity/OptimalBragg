# Design of Mirror Coatings by global optimization of a cost function

For the mirror coatings, we have many constraints to satisfy:

1. Transmissivity of XX ppm at a wavelength of 1064 nm.
1. Similar at other wavelengths
1. Minimize Brownian thermal noise
1. Minimize Thermo-Optic noise
1. Minimize sensitivity of transmissivity to coating deposition errors
1. Minimize E-field at HR surface
1. Layers cannot be less than 1 nm thick or more than 1 micron.
